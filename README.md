# CalHacks-5.0-Project

This project was created in responce to the OmniSci challenge from CalHacks 5.0 that encouraged students students to take the provided Uber Movements data file and create a way to utilize the data set in a helpful manner or create a beneficial visual representation of the data.

In order to explore and utilize the Uber Movements data, we decided to create a web application that would allow the user to see potential travel times depending on the time of the day.
