# CalHacks-5.0-Project

This project was created in responce to the OmniSci challenge from CalHacks 5.0 that encouraged students students to take the provided Uber Movements data file and create a way to utilize the data set in a helpful manner or create a beneficial visual representation of the data.

In order to explore and utilize the Uber Movements data, we decided to create a web application that would allow the user to see potential travel times depending on the time of the day.

The code itself works by allowing the user to input a start and end location, which would then be turned into an SQL query sent to the API that OmniSci had also provided, which would return a graph of the travel times for each hour of the day.

Given we don't currently have access to the API any request sent in at the moment will return the same graph.
